Greetings dear visitor,

My name is Rafael,

I work as a backend engineer ( with more than fourteen years of experience - ✨ still making mistakes ✨ )

I use this github account for studying and exploration purposes

I’m interested in software architecture and backend software development ( PHP, Golang, Lua, Ruby, Rust and a little bit of Elixir )

I’m currently "building my own version of ..." Redis using Ruby ( following books and tutorials to achieve this goal )

How to reach me:
