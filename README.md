Greetings dear visitor,

My name is Rafael,

I work as a backend engineer ( with more than fourteen years of experience - ✨ still making mistakes ✨ )

I’m interested in software architecture and backend development ( PHP, Golang, Lua, Ruby, Javascript and Rust )

I’m currently building a CLI tool for students to log their study time using GoLang and SQLite3 ( It is private for now )

This github account is used for studying purposes

How to reach me:

- [X](https://x.com/ocricci)
